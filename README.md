# Welcome to the AM Parking App Repository
This repository contains a functional guest parking app.

### 1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Abdiox/ParkingApp.git
```
### 2. Install the necessary dependencies:
```
cd ParkingApp
npm install
(If installation fails, try: npm install --legacy-peer-deps)
```
### 3. Start the application:
```

```
### 4. Download the Expo app on your mobile device if you haven't already:
